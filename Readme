Aldrich, Suzanne	aigeanta@cs.stanford.eduComment:Essay Section:	When "delete base;" executes at the bottom of main in DBRecord.cp, it invokes ~DBRecord, which calls DBRecord::FreeChunks, which executes "delete oldHead;". The first chunk is a special case because it is only half-filled. Therefore, when ~DBPair is automatically invoked, it invokes DBPair::ClearAttributeValue which in turn invokes DBPair::FreeString twice, but "delete [] str" is not executed on the null strings in pairs[1] (array elements are deleted from right to left); however, both strings in pairs[0] are deleted. At this point, there have been 4 calls to delete. There are 2 filled chunks left, so 2 oldHeads are deleted which causes 8 strings to be deleted. All in all, "delete base;" causes 14 deletes, including itself.
